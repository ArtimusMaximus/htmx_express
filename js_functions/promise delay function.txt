const delay = time => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, time))

then (no pun intended) you can chain onto this as:

delay(3000)
    .then(() => console.log('first delay'))
    .then(() => delay(3000))
    .then(() => console.log('second delay'))

if you dont put the callback function ( () => ), the next .then will execute immediately after the one before it
